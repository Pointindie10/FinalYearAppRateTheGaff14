# FinalYearAppRateTheGaff14
Final Year Project Android App that allows users to review rented accommodation. I created this Application for my final year project at
Ulster University.The app allows users to create an account to  make and view reviews. The database for the application is parse.com. Parse
is currently in the process of being terminated so how long it will work is down to that at the moment. Currently work is being done to replace 
parse.com with Alphabet`s firebase.
